"""Collision-proof filename generation for per-invocation evidence files.

Same pattern as the sibling `android_inspector` tool's `evidence.py`: an
in-process counter (`screenshot_0001.png`, `screenshot_0002.png`) is only
unique *within one process's lifetime*. It resets to zero every time a fresh
process starts, so two separate tool invocations (two separate `amplifier`
sessions, two separate test runs, two separate agent processes against the
same simulator/device) would silently overwrite each other's evidence the
moment they land on the same index.

The fix: derive the filename from a UTC timestamp (second resolution) plus
microseconds plus a short random suffix, so names sort chronologically and
are vanishingly unlikely to collide even across independent processes racing
at the same instant -- verified with an explicit existence check before ever
handing back a path, retrying on the rare collision rather than overwriting.
An optional in-process index may be appended purely for human-readable
ordering; it plays no role in collision prevention.
